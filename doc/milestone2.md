## Read
The Read endpoint provides the ability for the client to read information from a specific database, field, or localStorage. 
Some retreivable information include reading users' playlists, favorite songs, genre, artist, album, friends, and recent updates to their feed.
A common use case for this endpoint may be to retreive all of a user's friends' shared music on their timeline, and then retreiving even more information if a user clicks on the specific shared blurb.
